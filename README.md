# Computer Science from Scratch

<img align="left" src="README_images/ComputerScienceFromScratchCover.jpg" alt="Computer Science from Scratch Cover" height="200">

This repository contains all of the source code for the book *[Computer Science from Scratch: Building Interpreters, Art, Emulators and ML in Python](https://nostarch.com/computer-science-from-scratch)* by [David Kopec](https://davekopec.com) and published by No Starch Press. The book, intended for intermediate to advanced Python programmers, features 7 projects of varying complexity from the realm of interpreters, emulators, computer art, and simple machine learning.

The projects are compatible with Python 3.12 and above. You can find out more about the book at [computersciencefromscratch.com](https://computersciencefromscratch.com)

In the table below is a description of the 7 projects and further down in this README there are directions for running (and testing) each of them.

## Running and Testing Each Project

The following directions assume you are in the root directory of the repository in a terminal and that your Python command is `python` (on some systems it is `python3`). The code is tested against Python 3.12 and 3.13. It will not work with earlier versions. 

**Please note that each project is run as a module from the main repository using the `-m` option.**

## Type Hints
The code in this repository uses the latest type hinting features in Python 3.12 and above. If you are using an older version of Python, you may be able to run the code by removing some of the type hints, but no support is offered for that endeavor. All the type hints in the source code were checked using [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).
